# vim-plus

vim-plus is just my own vimrc and some scripts I made and some I collected.

It's meant to be included via pathogen, and sets things up as I like them.

* `save.vim` contains what you'd normally find in a .vimrc.
* `config.vim` got some mappings and configs for other plugins.
* `snippets.vim` some, well, snippets.
* Rest is stuff I found/built.
